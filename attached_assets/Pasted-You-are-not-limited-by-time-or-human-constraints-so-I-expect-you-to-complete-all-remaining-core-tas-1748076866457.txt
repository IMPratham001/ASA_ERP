You are not limited by time or human constraints, so I expect you to complete all remaining core tasks for ASA ERP **rapidly and in parallel**, not one-by-one. Start executing all high-priority modules **now**, assuming full system access. Implement the following immediately and provide full updated paths and code for each:

âœ… 1. CORS Fix (Laravel)
- Add and configure middleware at `app/Http/Middleware/Cors.php`
- Update config in `config/cors.php`
- Ensure preflight support and dynamic origin handling

âœ… 2. Prisma PostgreSQL Connection Test
- Create and validate a DB test endpoint at `lib/db/test-connection.ts`
- Sync schema using `npx prisma migrate dev`
- Confirm successful connection with dummy fetch

âœ… 3. PDF Generation Engine (Laravel)
- Enhance `app/Services/PDF/TemplateService.php`
- Add: dynamic field mapping, preview system, multilingual font support (Gujarati, Hindi, English)
- Enable RTL rendering and proper Indic font fallback (e.g., Noto Sans, Lohit)
- Add QR code and watermark generation
- Enable template preview + dummy data test rendering

âœ… 4. Add Font Files
- Add required Indic fonts to `resources/fonts` and load them in PDF service
- Integrate font config into PDF rendering logic

âœ… 5. Financial API Schemas
- Implement endpoints for Invoice, Payment, Ledger in `routes/api.php` and `app/Http/Controllers/Finance`
- Use proper request validation with `FormRequest` classes
- Define resource transformers (API Resource classes) for clean output

âœ… 6. Real-time Notification Setup (Optional for Phase 2)
- Begin Redis + Laravel Echo setup
- Add Socket.IO base client code at `lib/api/socket.ts`

Also:
- Replace all mock data in frontend with live API requests
- Setup proper error boundary + fallback UI for failed API calls

Return a structured update with:
1. âœ… File paths & code changes
2. ðŸ“‚ Folder structure updates
3. ðŸš€ Next recommended batch (if any)

Time is not a constraint. Complete all the above simultaneously and return full codebase update details now.
