Improve the following areas with high attention to design consistency, responsiveness, and user clarity:

1. Navigation Sidebar Enhancement
Add active state highlighting for the current route.

Implement hover tooltips for icons when the sidebar is collapsed.

Add smooth animation for expanding/collapsing the sidebar.

Support a mini variant for mobile view that overlays the screen.

Make sure the sidebar is sticky and scrollable on smaller screens.

2. Dashboard Visual Polish
Add placeholder loading skeletons for dashboard cards and charts.

Improve spacing, alignment, and layout consistency.

Use iconography and visual cues to enhance readability.

Animate chart transitions using Framer Motion or similar.

3. Customer & Staff Tables
Improve table readability with zebra striping and hover effects.

Add status badges with clear color schemes for Active/Inactive.

Implement column-based filtering, sorting icons, and searchable table headers.

Add pagination and make the table layout responsive for mobile.

4. Modal & Form Improvements
Refine modal transitions and ensure accessibility (focus traps, ESC close).

Align form field labels, add input validation styles, and consistent spacing.

Add toggle switches, select dropdowns, and date pickers using Shadcn UI.

Ensure all forms adapt well on mobile, using proper grid or stack layouts.

5. Dark Mode & Theme Consistency
Ensure all components work seamlessly in both light and dark mode.

Standardize color usage via Tailwind tokens (e.g., bg-background, text-muted).

Use theme-aware icons and input borders.

6. Responsive UI Optimization
Review all major screens for mobile usability.

Use Tailwindâ€™s responsive utilities to fix overflow issues, stacking problems, and spacing bugs.

Make sidebar collapsible on tablets, and overlays on mobile.

Test interactions like modals, buttons, and dropdowns on touch devices.

7. General UI/UX Enhancements
Add subtle hover animations and micro-interactions for buttons, icons, and cards.

Ensure consistent use of buttons (<Button variant="default">, etc.) across the app.

Use motion/transition effects where appropriate for user feedback.

Add toast notifications for user actions like form submission success/failure (UI-only, no actual backend hook).

Notes:
Use only frontend logic. Assume static or placeholder data if needed.

Maintain clean, semantic, and accessible HTML structure.

Use Tailwind and Shadcn UI components where possible.

Avoid adding custom libraries unless absolutely necessary.
