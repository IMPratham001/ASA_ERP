PDF Engine Setup
Use system fonts that support Gujarati and Hindi to avoid font issues.

Keep fonts organized in a dedicated folder inside your backend storage.

Design your watermark system to be dynamic, allowing different watermarks for different document types.

Ensure QR codes can embed various data formats like plain text, URLs, or JSON, and appear correctly in the PDF.

Financial Engine
Support recurring transactions with flexible frequency options: daily, weekly, and monthly.

Accurately calculate GST, including different tax rates (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%) and manage the split between IGST and CGST+SGST as per location.

Invoice System
Provide multiple invoice templates with customization options for users.

Enable export of reports in CSV, Excel, and PDF with proper formatting and data integrity.

Integrate digital signatures for authentication and legal compliance of invoices.

Real-Time Layer
Implement WebSocket integration for real-time features like notifications and live updates.

Store notifications persistently in the database to allow users to view past alerts.

Include user segmentation so notifications can target specific groups efficiently.

Technical & Performance Setup
Use a modern testing framework like Pest to maintain code quality and simplify testing.

Implement caching strategies at the API and database levels to improve speed and reduce load.

Set up clear API documentation for internal or external use, ensuring ease of integration and maintenance.

Codebase Cleanup & Structure
Identify and remove any unused or obsolete files and folders to keep the project lean.

Organize your project directories logically, grouping similar files (controllers, services, models) for easy navigation.

Maintain clear documentation covering setup, development guidelines, and module explanations for your team.

Next Step Focus Areas
Configure key system settings like broadcasting, caching, and CORS early in your project setup.

Develop core services graduallyâ€”starting with PDF templates and financial transaction controllers.

Organize your font assets and other static resources in dedicated folders with proper access rights.

Ensure all required third-party packages (PDF generation, WebSocket, testing frameworks) are integrated and configured properly.

Plan for WebSocket server setup and migration of necessary database tables.

Continuously clean and organize your codebase during development to avoid technical debt.
