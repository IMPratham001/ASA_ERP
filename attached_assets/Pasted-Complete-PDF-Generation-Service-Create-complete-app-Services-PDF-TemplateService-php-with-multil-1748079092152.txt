resources/fonts/ (add placeholders for Gujarati/Hindi/English fonts)

Stub all dependent helpers/utilities (e.g. QR code generator, watermark utils)

(stub validation rules for all financial inputs)

Utilities/helpers for tax calculations, currency formatting (stub files)

Test files for finance API in tests/Feature/FinanceApiTest.php (empty or basic test scaffolds)

Real-Time Updates Preparation

Create WebSocket server scaffold:

Laravel Echo server config files (e.g., config/echo.php)

Events: app/Events/FinancialTransactionCreated.php (empty class stub)

Listeners folder & stub classes (e.g., app/Listeners/NotifyClients.php)

Frontend event subscription endpoints stubbed in API routes for future implementation
