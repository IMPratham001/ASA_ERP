. Feature Inclusion
✔️ Yes, I want to include all features shown in the screenshots, with full functional parity and production-readiness. These features are critical for the ASA ERP system and should be implemented as core modules:

Customer Management: Including detailed customer profiles with contact information, transaction history, payment terms, and communication logs.

Item/Product Catalog: Full item master with support for SKUs, item images, categories, pricing tiers, stock levels, and tax settings.

Invoice Creation: Dynamic invoice builder with support for line items, quantity, unit pricing, automatic tax/discount calculations, subtotals, and grand total.

Tax & Discount Engine: Rule-based taxation (GST, VAT, etc.), support for inclusive/exclusive tax formats, flat and percentage-based discounts.

Terms & Conditions Customization: Editable T&C fields for quotes, invoices, and payments; with templating and multi-language support if possible.

Multi-Currency Support: Real-time exchange rates, multi-currency billing and reporting, currency-specific rounding rules.

Customer Portal: A secure self-service portal where clients can view quotes, download invoices, make payments, and track order status.

2. UI/UX Design Direction
✔️ Yes, we will retain the same modern UI layout and structure shown in the reference screenshots:

Dark sidebar with icon-based navigation

Light content area for enhanced readability and focus

UI components should be responsive, accessible (WCAG AA compliant), and offer a consistent experience across desktop and mobile

We may enhance the UI slightly with animations, loading states, and alert toasts — but the base layout, color scheme, and structure should remain consistent.

3. Sidebar Navigation Sections (Modules to Include)
✔️ Yes, the following sidebar sections should be implemented as first-class modules:

Home / Dashboard: Central KPIs, charts, pending actions, and financial summaries

Customers: Full customer management, advanced search, filters, contact details, payment history

Items: Inventory catalog with categories, pricing, and tax settings

Invoices: Create, view, edit, send, and track invoices with templates

Payments Received: Track payments, match against invoices, generate receipts

Expenses: Record business expenses, vendor details, category tagging

Time Tracking: Manual and timer-based tracking for billable hours

Reports: Financial, tax, sales, and time-based reports with filters and export options

❌ We will exclude: "Quotes", "Delivery Challans", and "Advanced Billing" for now, but the system should be scalable to add them in future phases.

4. Invoice Customization Requirements
✔️ Yes, we require full invoice customization capabilities, including:

Custom Templates: Multiple invoice design layouts (basic, modern, minimalist), switchable per customer or invoice type

Company Branding: Upload company logos, letterheads, and brand colors

Terms & Conditions Editor: Rich text editor with saved templates

Custom Fields: Add/remove fields like "PO Number", "Reference", "Custom Notes", etc., with optional visibility and positioning controls

5. Product/Item Management Requirements
✔️ Yes, item management should be robust and scalable, with the following features:

Item Categories: Organize products/services by categories and subcategories

Unit Prices: Multiple pricing strategies (fixed, tiered, cost+markup)

Stock Tracking: Basic inventory management (opening stock, current stock, reorder alerts, etc.)

Tax Rates Per Item: Define default tax rates per item (e.g., GST 18%, VAT 5%), including HSN/SAC codes if needed
