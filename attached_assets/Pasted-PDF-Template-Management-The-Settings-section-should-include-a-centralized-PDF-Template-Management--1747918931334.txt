PDF Template Management:

The Settings section should include a centralized PDF Template Management Module, allowing administrators to:

View, edit, clone, and delete all existing PDF templates (e.g., invoices, delivery challans, estimates, product labels).

Create custom PDF templates using a drag-and-drop editor or structured HTML-based template builder.

Assign different templates per store, document type, or customer type.

Support multi-language output (Gujarati, Hindi, English).

Preview templates live with sample data before saving.

Barcode Scanner & Thermal Printer Integration:

The ERP should support plug-and-play compatibility with standard barcode scanners and thermal printers.

Barcode scanner should integrate seamlessly in:

Product entry screens (to avoid manual typing).

Sales & Purchase entries (for real-time product retrieval).

Stock adjustments, returns, and internal transfers.

Mandatory Barcode on Product Creation:

Enforce a rule in the product creation module where a barcode is mandatory before a product can be saved.

Allow manual entry or auto-generation of barcodes with configurable formats (e.g., SKU-based, category prefix, etc.).

Include an option to scan an existing barcode and assign it.

Barcode Batch Printing:

Include a dedicated Barcode Printing Module with batch printing capability, similar to Miracle Accounting Software.

Features:

Select multiple products or a whole category.

Input quantity per product for how many labels are needed.

Preview and bulk print to compatible thermal printers (e.g., 2-inch or 3-inch).

Support label layout customization including:

Logo/branding

Product name

Barcode (with EAN/UPC/QR support)

MRP, batch number, expiry (if applicable)

Other Considerations:

Save template preferences per user or user role (admin, manager, warehouse staff).

Logs for barcode generation and printing activity for auditing.

Barcode reprint option from the product list or history logs.

Ensure responsive support for both desktop and mobile environments (especially barcode scanning on mobile).
