You are assisting in the development of ASA ERP (Aanshi Shringar Art). The system uses:

Frontend: Next.js (React)

Backend: Laravel (PHP), Prisma ORM (Node.js), PostgreSQL

Please follow this directive:

âœ… Proceed with the following implementations based on my answers:
ðŸ”´ PDF Engine
Use Lohit Gujarati and Lohit Devanagari fonts for multilingual PDF generation (Gujarati + Hindi support).

Implement dynamic watermarks per PDF template:

Example watermark text: customer name, invoice number, or custom field from template.

Generate QR codes in the format:
https://asaerp.in/invoice/view/{invoice_id}
Fallback to plain text if URL not available.

ðŸ”µ Financial Engine
Add support for Recurring Transactions with these intervals:
Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly

Implement GST logic for:

5%, 12%, 18%, 28%

Handle IGST vs CGST + SGST based on interstate/intrastate flag

ðŸŸ¢ Invoice System
Setup dashboard section for invoice generation with two templates:

Minimal Template (Quick overview)

Detailed Template (Tax, Terms, Company Details)

Add support for PDF and CSV export

Enable placeholder digital signature support (image upload)

ðŸŸ£ Real-Time Layer
Use Laravel WebSockets (self-hosted) instead of Pusher

Store notifications in DB with:

Read/Unread state

Role-based delivery (e.g., only to Admins or Managers)

âšª Technical Setup
Use Pest for Laravel testing

Enable query-level caching for key DB queries

Setup Swagger API documentation (password protected for internal use)

ðŸ§© Additional Notes:
Ensure all implemented features appear in the user interface â€” either through navigation links, dashboard widgets, or dedicated pages.

Create the following missing files as part of setup:

Laravel broadcasting config (config/broadcasting.php)

WebSocket server setup (websockets.php, middleware, routes)

Font assets directory for PDF

Cache configuration (config/cache.php)

ðŸš€ Once this is complete, update me with:
