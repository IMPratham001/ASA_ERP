1. Do you want to start with specific template types (invoices, delivery challans, etc.)?
‚úÖ Yes. Start with the most essential templates that cover majority use-cases:

Sales Invoice

Delivery Challan

Estimate/Quotation

Product Barcode Label

Purchase Invoice

Payment Receipt

Ledger/Account Statement

(Optional Phase 2: Credit Note, Debit Note, Return Vouchers)

2. Should we implement the drag-and-drop editor first or start with HTML-based templates?
üî∞ Start with HTML-based templates with JSON or Blade variables for dynamic fields.
üëâ Later (Phase 2), add a drag-and-drop visual builder with a live preview, especially useful for users without coding knowledge.

3. What data fields need to be available in the templates?
Include a comprehensive set of dynamic fields, grouped below:

Company/Store Info:
{company_name}, {address}, {gstin}, {phone}, {email}, {logo}

Customer Info:
{customer_name}, {address}, {contact}, {gstin}, {city}, {state}

Invoice Info:
{invoice_number}, {invoice_date}, {due_date}, {challan_number}, {estimate_number}

Product Info (Loop):
{product_name}, {product_code}, {barcode}, {rate}, {quantity}, {amount}, {hsn_code}, {gst_percent}, {discount}

Totals:
{subtotal}, {discount_total}, {tax_total}, {grand_total}, {amount_in_words}

Footer & Notes:
{terms_conditions}, {signature_area}, {footer_note}

Custom Fields (for all modules) should also be supported dynamically.

üî∂ Barcode Functionality
1. Do you have specific barcode scanner hardware in mind?
üéØ Support standard USB barcode scanners (plug-and-play like Honeywell, Zebra, TVS).
In future, support mobile camera barcode scanning via JS library like QuaggaJS or ZXing for mobile users.

2. What barcode format do you prefer (EAN-13, Code128, QR)?
‚úÖ Start with Code128 for product labeling and inventory.
üî≤ Add EAN-13 support for products sold in retail.
üü© QR Code should be available optionally (Phase 2), useful for linking to product URLs, manuals, or external pages.

3. Should we implement both auto-generation and manual entry first?
‚úî Yes:

Auto-generation: Default format with customizable prefix, suffix, and numbering rules.

Manual entry: For imported or pre-barcoded products (especially if using external packaging).

üî∂ Thermal Printer Integration
1. What thermal printer models do you plan to support?
Support the most widely used models:

TSC TE244 / TTP Series

TVS LP46 / LP45

Zebra ZD220 / GK420T

(Support via ESC/POS, ZPL, or USB Printing API)

2. Do you need specific label sizes/formats?
Yes, support standard barcode label formats:

1.5 x 1 inch (most common)

2 x 1 inch

2 x 2 inch

Roll-type or continuous roll support
‚û°Ô∏è Option to customize layout and label content (company logo, MRP, SKU, barcode, name).

3. Should we implement batch printing first or single label printing?
üéØ Implement batch printing first, since it's essential for production.
‚úÖ Also keep single label printing for ad-hoc entries or corrections.

üî∂ Multilingual Support
1. Should we start with all languages (Gujarati, Hindi, English) or implement one first?
‚úî Start with English as default.
‚û°Ô∏è Add Gujarati & Hindi in the next phase (should be toggleable per user or document).

2. Do you need right-to-left support for any languages?
‚ùå No need for right-to-left (RTL) support initially, as Gujarati, Hindi, and English are all LTR (left-to-right).
