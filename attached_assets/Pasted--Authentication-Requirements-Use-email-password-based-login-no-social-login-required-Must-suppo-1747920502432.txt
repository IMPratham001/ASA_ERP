❓ Questions to Answer Before Starting
📄 PDF Templates
Should each document type (invoice, PO, etc.) have multiple versions/templates?

Do you want the WYSIWYG editor now or in Phase 2?

Do you want users to upload logos, or should it be fixed from the store’s settings?

🔍 Barcode
What barcode format should be default? (EAN-13, Code128, QR?)

Should the barcode be shown on invoice/PDFs?

Do you have an existing barcode printing format or label design we should match?

🖨️ Thermal Printers
Which exact thermal printer models are you currently using?

Do you want the system to auto-detect printers or use a print service bridge (like PrintNode)?

What are the label size options you plan to support?

🌐 Multi-language
Who will enter translations for Gujarati and Hindi – or should it be auto-translated?

Do you want customers to see invoices in their preferred language?

🏪 Multi-store
Should each store have its own invoice template, or should they all use the master template?

Can stores share inventory, or should it be isolated?

Do you want a store switcher in the UI for admins?

🔐 Authentication
Will all users be created by the admin only, or should self-registration be allowed?
